        <p class="recipe1"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Grease the cake tin with butter and line with baking paper, then grease the paper too. Heat the oven to 140°C fan/gas 3.
</p>
        <p class="recipe1"><strong>Step 2:</strong> To make the cake, put the butter, sugar and treacle in a pan and heat gently, stirring occasionally, until melted together. Stir in the marmalade and orange zest, then remove from the heat and when just tepid, stir in the eggs.</p>
        <p class="recipe1"><strong>Step 3:</strong>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, pepper, salt and cloves, then stir in the stem ginger. Pour the treacle mixture over the dry ingredients and stir it all together with a rubber spatula. When well combined, pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick pushed into the middle of the cake comes out clean. </p>

         <p class="recipe2"><strong>Step 1:</strong>Heat the oil in a small pan over a medium heat. Add the shallot and a good pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 minutes until soft. Stir in the gochujang and two thirds of the garlic and cook for another minute or two, then remove from the heat and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes.</p>
         <p class="recipe2"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, stir the remaining garlic into the mayonnaise and season well.</p>
          <p class="recipe2"><strong>Step 3:</strong>Put the drained beans in a bowl and crush lightly with a potato masher – you want them to break down enough that they become tacky and form a bit of a paste but you still want some of the bean texture. Stir through the shallot mixture then divide into 6 equal balls. Put each ball between 2 small sheets of baking paper then flatten out until 1cm thick with a rolling pin.</p>
