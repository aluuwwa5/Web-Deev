    <h1>A Snow Man</h1>
    <p>
    Oh, the beautiful snow!<br>
We’re all in a glow—<br>
Nell, Dolly, and Willie, and Dan;<br>
For the primest of fun,<br>
When all’s said and done,<br>
Is just making a big snow man.<br>
Two stones for his eyes<br>
Look quite owlishly wise,<br>
A hard pinch of snow for his nose;<br>
Then a mouth that’s as big<br>
As the snout of a pig,<br>
    </p>
